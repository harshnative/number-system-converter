# number-system-converter
this software can convert any number from any system to any system you want , this also as support for converting floating point or decimal numbers also 

you can directly donwload the exe file under the releases section of github 


->  if the exe file is not runnning then follow the following steps
    1. download the dev c++ form the following link { https://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html }
    2. install the software
    3. open the software and press ctrl + n
    4. copy the source code or just double click on the sourcecode.cpp and click compile
    5. save the file and the exe file will open and you can use the exe file directly which is located where you have saved the file initially
    
this simple 500 lines of code takes a lot of effort , firstly building the algoritm which the computer can understand and solve and then solving the errors consume time , so if are developer please contribute to the project 

"you can make changes and add feature accordingly or if you are not a developer , then you can contect me , hopefully i can help you" , refer the licensing terms for further details , please ask for the permission for redistributing the changed software via email , it will probably be free of charge as of now 

you can place it on the destop and change the icon so that it looks nice:)
